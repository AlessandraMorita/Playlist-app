 ## Why?
 
 I wanted to practice my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website. I also want to create features that make easy to create playlists.
 
 ## How To Use
 
 Click the link, and you’ll be directed to the deployed site:

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

## Project status 

The project is still being developed. Next challenges:

* Include more than one track per artist at a time
* Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
* Add a loading screen while playlist is saving
* After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect
* Ensure playlist information doesn’t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token
